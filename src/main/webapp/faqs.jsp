<h4>What is <i>Phragmites</i>?  Why is it a problem?</h4>
<br/>
<p>
	Although there are native <a target="_blank" href=http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquatics/commonreed.shtml><i>Phragmites</i></a> types 
	endemic to North America, a highly invasive Eurasian subspecies 
	began establishing itself here during the 1800s.  The invasive type can grow up to 5 m in height and form 
	impenetrable stands that can quickly degrade large areas of highly productive coastal wetlands and shorelines.   
	<i>Phragmites</i> invasions can hinder access to, and use of, beaches and recreation areas; present a fire hazard; 
	reduce the property value of coastal homes; physically alter the landscape structure; and impact critical natural habitat 
	for fish and wildlife.  In the Great Lakes coastal zone, <i>Phragmites</i> has shown that it can rapidly colonize mudflats exposed 
	by low lake levels.  <i>Phragmites</i> management is a common objective of private and public land managers. Current management 
	efforts include mowing, burning, and herbicide application, but they are very costly and must be repeated to achieve long-term 
	success (Figure 1).
</p>

</p>
<br />
<p>
Studies have shown that early attention and treatment is critical for long-term success (Carlson et al. 2009).  In areas 
where <i>Phragmites</i> is already well established, complete eradication may be unrealistic, so a coordinated control strategy 
will help to maximize benefits per unit cost.  Funding was provided by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) for the 
development of a basin-wide distribution map and decision support tool.  The goal of this tool is to help users prioritize 
restoration efforts, identify areas most at risk to future invasions, and highlight areas where monitoring and rapid response 
can prevent future expansion.
</p>
<br />
<a id="what-is-dst"></a>
<h4>What is the <i>Phragmites</i> Decision Support Tool (DST), and how do I use it?</h4>
<br />
<p>
The DST is a map-based tool that consists of three integrated components: 1) a basin-wide distribution map of current 
<i>Phragmites</i> populations, 2) a habitat suitability index based on current environmental conditions, and 3) a map of 
potential invasion pathways defined by corridor networks that are weighted by proximity to existing <i>Phragmites</i>.  
Mapping existing invasive <i>Phragmites</i> utilized remotely sensed imagery and provided the basis for the other two components 
of the DST (<a target="_blank" href=http://www.mtri.org/phragmites.html>http://www.mtri.org/phragmites.html</a>).  The habitat suitability index 
is intended to provide land managers with a general estimation of relative vulnerability to future invasions based on 
environmental conditions.  It maps the relative habitat quality of the landscape for <i>Phragmites</i> establishment and 
is broken down into six different classes:  most suitable, more suitable, suitable, unsuitable, more unsuitable, and most 
unsuitable.  It is important to remember that <i>Phragmites</i> is an aggressive invader and can grow in surprising areas, 
including those classified as "unsuitable" in our maps.  The corridor networks consist of inland streams, wetlands, and water 
bodies as well as offshore corridors that may be exposed during periods of reduced lake levels and are thus vulnerable to 
<i>Phragmites</i> expansion.  The components of the DST are collectively intended to provide users with a robust depiction of 
vulnerability to future invasions and provide a spatial framework for planning, prioritized monitoring, control, and habitat 
restoration projects within the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes coastal zone (10 km inland from the shoreline). 
</p>
<br />
<a id="how-can-tools-inform"></a>
<h4>How can these tools inform different management scenarios?</h4>
<br />
<p>
The data contained in the DST represent landscape-scale information that can assist management decisions across the diverse 
range of conditions found within the Great Lakes basin. <i>Phragmites</i> prevalence varies widely across the basin, so 
appropriate management strategies for minimizing further invasions and implementing effective restoration projects also vary 
based on local conditions.  At basin- or lake-wide scales, the DST provides managers with a broad view of the range of <i>Phragmites'</i>
prevalence and allows the identification of areas with suitable habitat that are not yet colonized (Figure 2).  This information 
can highlight heavily infested areas where patches with high biodiversity are rare, identify regions where control efforts 
invested now could reduce long-term costs by preventing <i>Phragmites</i> from becoming well established, and guide monitoring
and early detection to prevent future encroachment.
</p>

</p>
<br />
<p>
At finer scales, the habitat suitability index and corridor networks provide insight to different aspects of vulnerability,
and may help to guide strategic control and restoration programs.  For example, in a heavily infested area, the reduced 
lake-level corridors identify where expansive shallow areas may become exposed and colonized (Figure 3).  Knowledge of 
these locations could help prioritize intensive control efforts to reduce future expansion or assist with the establishment 
of restoration projects.

suitability for <i>Phragmites</i> also are shown. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
In areas with intermediate densities of <i>Phragmites</i>, stands adjacent to or within large areas of suitable 
habitat could be preferentially targeted for immediate control efforts to slow expansion (Figure 4).  Suitable 
habitat adjacent to highly valued areas such as wildlife refuges or public beaches could be identified for monitoring 
and rapid response treatment to prevent the infestation of key features.

Northeastern Lake Michigan's coastal zone contains some large <i>Phragmites</i> stands within and near extensive 
areas of suitable habitat nearby. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
In sparsely invaded areas, the locations of existing <i>Phragmites</i> patches in relation to networks of coastal, 
riparian, and wetland corridors can identify likely expansion pathways and illustrate the need for early 
treatment (Figure 5).  Identifying isolated patches of <i>Phragmites</i> in these areas for treatment and targeting treatment 
areas adjacent to wetland and riparian corridors could minimize the <i>Phragmites</i> invasion.

<a id="how-map-was-developed"></a>
<h4>How was the distribution map developed?</h4>
<br />
<p>
Cooperative research between the USGS Great Lakes Science Center and Michigan Technical Research Institute (MTRI) led 
to the development of a distribution map of invasive <i>Phragmites</i> along the U. S. side of the Great Lakes coastal 
zone(10 km inland from the shoreline) .  MTRI scientists used satellite-based radar data and an extensive network of field sites to conduct an unsupervised 
and supervised remote sensing classification exercise and to perform an accuracy assessment of the resulting map.  
Satellite imagery came from multiple dates throughout the growing seasons of 2008-2010, and a total of 1,145 field sites 
from 2010 and 2011 were used to train and validate remote sensing classification methods. Mapping efforts identified dense 
stands that were larger than 0.2 ha (0.5 ac) and erred on the side of inclusion in order to identify as many areas potentially 
infested by <i>Phragmites</i> as possible (Bourgeau-Chavez el al. 2013).
</p>
<br />
<a id="habitat-suitability-estimated"></a>
<h4>How was habitat suitability estimated?</h4>
<br />
<p>
A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to sample environmental conditions and the newly developed 
<i>Phragmites</i> map across the study area (Carlson Mazur et al. 2014).  Existing GIS data were gathered and processed to produce a set 
of 87 candidate variables describing environmental conditions.  These variables were hypothesized to directly 
influence <i>Phragmites</i> distribution or to serve as surrogates for processes or conditions that are direct 
influences based on a conceptual model of <i>Phragmites'</i> biological requirements.  The initial set of 87 
candidate variables was reduced to 15 for use as predictors of <i>Phragmites</i> occurrence.  Statistical models 
(boosted regression trees) were used to estimate the ecological niche of <i>Phragmites</i>.  These models produced 
a continuous index of habitat suitability which was reclassified to depict six categories of relative quality.
</p>
<br />
<p>

	which is available for download.
	An <a target="_blank" href="http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/documents/CountyAppendix_CarlsonMazur2014.pdf">appendix</a>
	that provides county-level summaries of current Phragmites extent, both offshore and total area in each county, is also available.
</p>
<br />
<a id="what-environmental-conditions"></a>
<h4>What environmental conditions most influence current <i>Phragmites</i> distribution at a basin-wide scale?</h4>
<br />
<p>
<i>Phragmites</i> distribution was tied most closely with topography, proximity to development, soil conditions, 
and road density.  In general, <i>Phragmites</i> in the Great Lakes coastal zone tends to prefer flatter areas 
that are close to development.  Shallow or poorly drained soils and a relatively high road density are also 
tied closely with <i>Phragmites</i> occurrence (Carlson Mazur et al. 2014).
</p>
<br />
<a id="data-to-construct-corridor"></a>
<h4>What data were used to construct the vulnerable corridor network?</h4>
<br/>
<p>
The corridor network has an inland portion made up of streams and rivers, wetlands, and water bodies, and 
coastal/offshore portions composed of simulated reduced lake-level scenarios.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Features that comprise the 
inland portion came from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/HSC-wth04.php">National Hydrography Dataset</a>
and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/index.html">National Wetlands Inventory</a>. Lines associated 
with the inland portion of the network that run through connecting channels and in to the open water of Lake St. Clair are due to
the NHD maintaining network connectivity between the lower Great Lakes.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Simulated offshore corridors of two reduced lake levels came from two data sources.  Where available, recently 
acquired high resolution LIDAR topo-bathymetric data were used to estimate the areas exposed by 50 cm and 1.0 m 
lake-level reductions based on mean 2009 conditions.  Acquisition of LIDAR-based topo-bathymetry is limited 
in areas of high turbidity and aquatic vegetation.  Therefore, a 1.0 m depth bathymetric contour joined with 
the shoreline provided a separate estimation of the corridor exposed by a 1.0 m lake-level reduction for three 
of the Great Lakes (Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario) and Lake St. Clair.  This contour line was used 
for those areas missing LIDAR data.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Offshore and inland corridors were weighted by distance to existing <i>Phragmites</i>.  This allows a simple 
and easily interpretable means for assessing relative vulnerability to future expansion within corridor networks 
in addition to the habitat suitability index.
</p>
<br/>
<a id="water-level-fluctuations"></a>
<h4>Are water level fluctuations tied to <i>Phragmites</i> distribution?</h4>
<br />
<p>
Lake levels are dynamic, and the monitoring record has shown that the magnitude, duration, and frequency of 
low lake levels (i.e., below 2009 mean annual levels) vary from lake to lake.  Figure 6 shows the history of 
lake-level fluctuations with respect to the two magnitudes of reduced lake-level scenarios that we considered 
for assessing vulnerable offshore coastal corridors.
</p>
<br/>
<img src="images/faqs/hydrographs.png" />
<br/>
<p><b>Figure 6. </b>Hydrographs for the Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair show the history of periods of reduced lake levels.</p>
<br/>
<p>
Mean 2009 levels were used as a base line for simulating lake-level reductions because the goal of this project 
was to forecast likely expansion patterns, and 2009 marked the time between which imagery was gathered and 
ground truthing conducted to establish the current <i>Phragmites</i> extent maps.  It should be noted that 2009 lake 
levels in Lakes Huron and Michigan were relatively lower than those in the lower Great Lakes based on long-term 
records, so fixed lake-level reduction scenarios based on 2009 levels also occurred less frequently in the past 
for Lakes Huron and Michigan.  Lake Superior and Lake Ontario did not experience the degree of low lake levels 
seen in the other lakes during the 2000-2010 decade, and this may be related to <i>Phragmites'</i> relative scarcity in those lakes.
</p>
<br />
<a id="how-climate-change-impact"></a>
<h4>How might climate change impact the coastal corridors?</h4>
<br />
<p>
Climate change has the potential to alter the timing and spatial patterns of both temperature and precipitation 
across the Great Lakes.  The onset and duration of the growing season interact with precipitation rates to influence 
lake levels, and these interactions are complex, contain feedback loops, and are difficult to accurately predict 
given the uncertainty of future climate conditions.  Given these uncertainties, climate change may reduce water 
levels and increase disturbance through extreme precipitation events and flooding, thereby exposing new areas for 
<i>Phragmites</i> establishment (Angel et al. 2010).  Longer growing seasons and nutrient processing dynamics may 
give <i>Phragmites</i> additional competitive advantages.
</p>
<br />
<a id="what-limitations"></a>
<h4>What are some limitations of the DST?</h4>
<br />
<p>
Mapping identified large (&gt;0.2 ha or 0.5 ac) patches dominated by <i>Phragmites</i>, not small stands or mixed 
communities that might exist early in an invasion.  As such, distribution maps do not represent early detection 
tools in and of themselves, and cannot take the place of monitoring efforts that may be capable of identifying and 
eradicating invasive <i>Phragmites</i> before it becomes well established.  In addition, narrow linear features 
such as roadside ditches would not be identified in distribution maps, although these may have been present for 
years and may be important features as propagule sources and dispersion routes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
In order to identify as much <i>Phragmites</i> as possible, mapping methods intentionally erred on the side of 
inclusion, so areas falsely identified as occupied by <i>Phragmites</i> by mapping (errors of commission) are 
more frequent than areas with <i>Phragmites</i> on the ground that were not identified by mapping (errors of omission).
</p>
<br />
<p>
Habitat suitability modeling relies on the controls to distribution posed by environmental conditions rather 
than the spatial context of a species' introduction history.  These models use the realized ecological niche 
to estimate the potential niche, and this estimation provides one way to assess vulnerability (Coutts et al. 
2011, Elith et al. 2010, Anderson et al. 2006).  However, the propagule pressure resulting from proximity to 
well established stands provides an alternative means to assessing vulnerability, and considering both an 
area's environmental conditions and its position in relation to established stands provides a more robust 
picture of likely future expansion patterns.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Habitat suitability estimates were derived from point-specific samples of data sources with multiple original
scales.  A 100-m spacing of sample points was used to construct a spatially continuous grid surface that 
depicts the general relative suitability of an area based on environmental conditions. This methodology does 
not produce a spatially precise determination of whether <i>Phragmites</i> will or will not be capable of colonizing 
discrete patches in the absence of control efforts.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Offshore coastal corridors were estimated only where data were available to do so.  Where it was collected, 
lidar bathymetry sometimes only covered narrow offshore swaths and not areas with high turbidity or abundant 
aquatic vegetation such as in Lake St. Clair, western Lake Erie, and Saginaw Bay.  The reduced lake-level 
corridors simulated from lidar in these areas likely extend further offshore than depicted, so care should 
be used when these corridors directly abut the 'lidar unavailable' layer.  The 1-m depth contour used as an 
alternative means to simulate a reduced lake-level corridor was not available for Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, 
or northern Lake Huron.
